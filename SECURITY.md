# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest major version of this project is currently receiving security updates. We do not support older versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security reports seriously and appreciate the efforts of security researchers. Please follow these guidelines to report any potential vulnerabilities.

### How to report

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue.** Instead, report vulnerabilities by emailing a security report to **[your-email-here]**. If you prefer to use PGP encryption, please use our public key, which can be found at **[link-to-your-pgp-key]**.

Your report should include the following:
*   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The version(s) of the project that are affected.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) or exploit code, if available.
*   Information on any potential impact or risk.

### Responsible Disclosure

By submitting a report, you agree to a responsible disclosure process. This means:
*   You will not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a reasonable amount of time to fix it (typically 90 days).
*   You will make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, or destruction of data.
*   We will keep your report confidential and will not share your personal information with third parties without your permission, unless required by law.

### Our response

We commit to the following response timeline for all submitted vulnerability reports:
*   **Acknowledgement:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within [e.g., 5 business days] and will confirm the start of our investigation.
*   **Assessment:** We will perform an initial assessment to validate the vulnerability and determine its severity and impact.
*   **Communication:** We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the remediation process.
*   **Disclosure:** Once a fix is ready, we will coordinate a public disclosure with you, which may include a security advisory and credit for your discovery.

## Security Practices

Our team follows these practices to help ensure the security of this project:
*   **Dependency Scanning:** We use automated tools (e.g., Dependabot alerts) to monitor for known vulnerabilities in our dependencies and will promptly release patches for any discovered issues.
*   **Code Scanning:** We use static analysis tools to automatically scan our codebase for potential security vulnerabilities during our development workflow.
*   **Branch Protection:** We enforce branch protection rules on important branches (e.g., `main`) to prevent unauthorized or untested changes.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** All privileged contributors are encouraged to enable multi-factor authentication on their GitHub accounts.
