# Algorave Share

Share and discover code and audio generated by Strudel or TidalCycles.

## 🎵 About

Algorave Share is a platform for live coders to share their creations, whether it's code patterns from Strudel or TidalCycles, or audio recordings of their performances. Built with modern technologies for reliability and developer experience.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses an infrastructure-as-code approach with the following stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Effect for functional programming
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform for AWS resources
- **Effect Library**: Used throughout frontend and backend for type-safe, composable code

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or yarn
- Terraform (for infrastructure deployment)
- AWS credentials (for infrastructure deployment)

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend API will be available at http://localhost:3001

### Infrastructure Deployment

```bash
cd infrastructure
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

See `infrastructure/README.md` for detailed infrastructure documentation.
